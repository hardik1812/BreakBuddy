## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The core "Friend Status" feature works by:
1.  Fetching the current day and time.
2.  Accessing the timetable data of a friend from the Firestore database for that specific day.
3.  Iterating through their scheduled classes.
4.  Comparing the current time with the `startTime` and `endTime` of each class.
5.  If the current time falls within any class duration, the friend's status is marked as "In Class" (üî¥). Otherwise, they are "Free" (üü¢).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Firebase Structure

The app is built with a modern stack, relying on Google's Firebase for its backend.

- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**:
    - **Firebase Authentication**: For user management.
    - **Cloud Firestore**: A NoSQL database for storing user, timetable, and friend data.

### Firestore Data Model:

1.  **Users Collection**: Stores basic user information.
    ```
    /users/{auth_uid}/
      - id: "22BCE1234" (Student ID)
      - name: "Student Name"
      - email: "student@example.com"
    ```

2.  **Friends Sub-collection**: Stores a user's list of friends.
    ```
    /users/{auth_uid}/friends/{friend_doc_id}
      - fid: "22BCE5678" (Friend's Student ID)
      - Name: "Friend Name"
    ```

3.  **Timetable Collection**: Stores the timetable for each user, identified by their student ID.
    ```
    /timetable/{student_id}/{day_of_week}/{class_doc_id}
      - className: "Data Structures"
      - startTime: "09:00"
      - endTime: "09:50"
      - classType: "Theory"
      - ...
    ```
